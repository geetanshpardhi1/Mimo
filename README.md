# Mimo

Mimo is a personal memory recall app. It helps people capture meaningful thoughts, quotes, links, and moments, then later find them by describing how they remember them — not where they saved them.

## Why This App Exists
People save important content across many places (videos, books, notes, screenshots), but when they want to find something again, they usually remember the feeling or the moment, not the exact location. Mimo is built to bridge that gap by letting people save the memory and later retrieve it using natural language.

## What Mimo Helps You Do
- Save meaningful snippets or links in seconds
- Add a bit of context like where you were or how you felt
- Recall past memories by describing them in your own words

## The Goal of This MVP
Validate one core idea: people want a simple way to save memories and retrieve them later using natural language. Success means users return and can actually find something they saved before.
